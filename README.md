**@Todo List:**
* setup Flyway with H2 and Postgresql
* schema migration and data imports
* data changes (field name / type changes)
* legacy schema adoption (I have existing schema and want to continue with Flyway)
* schema changes in team development (a few developers adds migration scripts in their branches)
* going from dev to production
* testing with Flyway
